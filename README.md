# 👋 I am piar

- Self-taught dev, reverse engineer in training, and digital archaeologist
- Currently working to master **hardware + software**
- I tinker with Wiis

### 💻 What I'm About

- 🐧 I like linux
- 💿 Wii modder
- 🧠 Learning **Godot**, Python, scripting, and real-world dev workflows
- 🔧 Learning how to Make Wii homebrew apps
- 🌆 Designing a 2D game about a cybernetic stray cat in neon Tokyo, if of course it's a good day
- 🎮 Inspired by games like *Earthbound*, *Celeste*, and *Cuphead*
- 💔 Being nervous that AI will take over

### ⚙️ Tools & Tech I Like

- `Arch Linux` | `Python` | `GDScript` | `Wine` | `Batch scripting` | `Reverse engineering`
- Pixel art, retro aesthetics, and *doing it the hard way*

### 📼 Currently Working On

- 🚧 **v(aporwave)ii Party** – a vaporwave Wii Party mod. This is something I've wanted to do for a while. Most Wii Party mods aren't great.
- 🐾 **CYBRKTTY** – RPG + boss rush hybrid set in a techno-dystopian Tokyo. If I uh, sit down and learn Godot.
- 🛠️ Experimental Wii homebrew Python runner, though, this is definately something that I might drop.
