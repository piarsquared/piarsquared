# 👋 I am piar

- So, I'm currently learning a lot of stuff at the moment so there's really no solid thing I can say for sure will be done.
- Currently working to master **hardware + software**
- I tinker with Wiis

---

### 💻 What I'm About

- 🐧 I like linux
- 💿 Wii modder (Mostly retired now)
- 🧠 Learning **Godot**, Python, scripting, etc
- 🔧 Learning how to Make Wii homebrew apps
- 🌆 Designing a 2D game about a cybernetic stray cat in neon Tokyo, if of course it's a good day
- 🎮 Inspired by games like *Earthbound*, *Celeste*, and *Cuphead*
- 💔 Being nervous that AI will take over

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Tech I Like

- `Arch Linux` | `Python` | `GDScript` | `Wine` | `Batch scripting` | `Reverse engineering` | `Windows 11/10`
- Pixel art, retro aesthetics, I also do like modern aesthetics but almost everything online and with computers is modernized at this point.

### 📼 Currently Working On

- 🚧 **v(aporwave)ii Party** – a vaporwave Wii Party mod. This is something I've wanted to do for a while. Most Wii Party mods aren't great.
- 🐾 **CYBRKTTY** – RPG + boss rush hybrid set in a techno-dystopian Tokyo. If I uh, sit down and learn Godot.
- 🛠️ Never Gamble Python Port (This is subject to be moved to Godot)
